  <div class="aboutdilla">
  <p>What made Dilla special? If you could break his style down into three main components, they'd be his way with a vocal sample, his way with a beat, and his way with synths.</p>

<p>Dilla's signature, widely forged at the moment, is what tech-heads refer to as "unquantized drums". Quantization is a procedure that makes rhythms perfectly regular and grooves superhumanly tight. The gist of what Dilla did is to avoid quantising and go for a looser, human feel, fitful and fallible, sometimes pushing "off-beat" to the edge of plain wrong. Hip-hop headz talk of Dilla as the catalyst for "the return of the boom-bap".</p>

<p>And finally the synths, which burble and twitter through a lot of Dilla tracks, although it's often hard to tell if they are sampled off some obscure record or played on a vintage analogue keyboard. Even more than the cut-up "vocal science" and the stumbling beats, this is one of the most widely imitated aspects of Dilla's style, especially within that amorphous genre-not-genre known as Wonky.</p>

<p>Dilla was highly influential on pretty much every producer out right now; what was revolutionary when Dilla did it seems pedestrian now because everyone copies Dilla. Dilla was one of the first people to do a whole lot of little things that gained popularity after the fact. He was one of the first people to record live drums then cut the drum sample into the MPC. A lot of his beats had a fuckton of swing in them, sometimes he wouldn't quantize, sometimes he'd just let the sample loop with no drums, just little producer tricks that are commonplace now were considered "experimental" when he did them.</p>

<p>I selected 8 of my personal favorite Dilla productions, and explain why they're important to me. Some other hip-hop scholars may disagree.<p></div>

        <h2>"Runnin'" - The Pharcyde</h2>
        <p>I remember hearing this song for the first time on the radio when I was a kid. It absolutely grasped me upon the first listen. A couple days later I begged my mother to take me to a record store so I could buy the single. I went over to this girl's house I was interested in, and played it over and over. She was more into 2pac, so she was not into it. This was the first time I heard J-Dilla production, who was going by Jay Dee at the time. It's also the first time I was actually interested in reading the liner notes to find out who made the music.</p>
        <p>The spanish guitar strum and horn sample, with rhythmic breaks and drum drop-outs that Dilla was famous for.  Add to that the sing-songy lyricism of The Pharcyde, who were right up there with A Tribe Called Quest with how I revered them. It became an instant classic to me.</p>

      <h2>"Stakes Is High" - De La Soul</h2>
      <p>When De La Soul's "Stakes Is High" album came out, I was thoroughly enmeshed in hip-hop culture. I owned every Tribe record that was released. ATCQ and De La literally ruled my rap world, right along with Snoop and Dr. Dre. I've always been into things with opposite polarizations.</p>
      <p>I was waiting on this album to come out for months, just as I did with the Snoop album. When I finally got this album in my grubby, prepubescent hands, it did not disappoint. I was treated to lyrics of substance with beats full of soul. "Stakes Is High", when that dramatic horn sample hit along with the filtered bass, It hit me hard. I read the liner notes and I saw Dilla produced this song too. I really didn't know what it meant at the time, but I stated to myself that Dilla was my favorite producer.</p>

      <h2>"Fall In Love" - Slum Village</h2>
      <p>The first time I heard "Fall In Love", I was in a really hipster, underground lounge called, The Green Room in Honolulu, HI. The DJs there played some hip, eclectic, underground music. I was there for the first time with my buddy, Jovian, who was born and raised in East Los Angeles. He grew up with real East L.A. gangsters, but shared a love for true hip-hop, underground hip-hop and eclectic music just like I did. We were true outliers in everything we did, truthfully I think we were just ahead of our time and born 10-15 years too early. Its cool to be an individual in the current time, to have independent thoughts and tastes.</p>
      <p>There we were, enjoying the atmosphere and ambience of such a cool environment. The DJ had just played Sade's "<a href="https://youtu.be/x73PeAdq9BE">By Your Side</a>" remixed by Ben Watt, and then transitioned into this smooth, hip-hop song with rappers that with a halting, rhythmic cadence to their flow. The sing-songy chorus with the rhodes piano sample playing behind it. The song felt like magic, so we had to ask the DJ who he just played. He let us know it was a group called Slum Village. We had never heard of them, but definitely looked them up when we got back home. I saw the name of one of the group members, and it was Dilla, who served as their main producer and as a rapper in the group.</p>

      <h2>"Pause" - J Dilla feat. Frank-N-Dank</h2>
      <p>By this time, I was familiar with Dilla and was ready to buy whatever he put out.  Luckily I didn't have to wait long until he released his own album, "Welcome 2 Detroit", which was a part of BBE label's "Beat Generation" producer-driven album series. "Pause" was the song that stood out the most to me from this album. The title describes the vibe of it perfectly, the way the bass notes hit, there's a pause between it and when the snare cracks. Ruff, rugged and raw.</p>

      <h2>"F*ck The Police" - J Dilla</h2>
      <p>I actually never knew this was an actual song and not just a beat for years. I downloaded the Dilla beat, along with a bunch of other unreleased instrumentals. This was back in the day when I fancied myself as a rapper, and did actually rap over this. It wasn't that bad a track if I do say so myself. Remarkably, one of my lyrics I "spat" was "F*ck the cops...", without listening to Dilla's actual song or even knowing the title of the beat.</p>
      <p>Years later I heard the actual song with Dilla's vocals on it and loved it. I felt a kindred connection to him once I heard that we had the same concept for that particular beat.</p>

      <h2>"Best Seller" - Copywrite</h2>
      <p>I used to love the way Copywrite rhymed, rhyming the two last syllables in every line and rhyming within the lines. That sort of rapping always was very hypnotic to me. Copywrite was kind of like MF Doom in his rhyming style, but Doom was a lot more intricate with his rhyming schemes and wordplay. This doesn't take away from my appreciation of Copywrite's skill and this Dilla beat was a perfect soundstage for him to showcase. Copywrite went autobiographical on this track and the contemplative feeling of the beat works great with it. The sampled piano runs along with the strings are gorgeous.</p>

      <h2>"Time: The Donut Of The Heart" - J Dilla</h2>
      <p>Short but perfectly sweet, this instrumental was from Dilla's Donuts album that was released 3 days before his death. The entire album was created in his hospital room using a small Roland SP-303 sampler and a small 45 record player. Even in sickness with limited equipment, he was able to create some beautiful soulful sounds. This is what made Dilla special.</p>
      <p>The vocal chops alone on this one showcase his musical genius, and the bpm change in the middle is outstanding.</p>

      <h2>"Starz" - Jaylib</h2>
      <p>Madlib and Dilla teamed up to create the duo Jaylib, and a collaborative album titled "Champion Sound". Both of them are considered sample-chopping geniuses and the album more than showed that they were just that. It consisted of songs where one would produce the beat and the other would rap over it, alternating each song. When that bass note and kick combine, as well as that snappy snare with sped up vocal sample as a backdrop, it was quintessential hip-hop.</p>
